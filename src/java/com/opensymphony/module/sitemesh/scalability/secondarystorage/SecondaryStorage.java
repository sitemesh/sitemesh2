 * until the first char has been written to it.  This will ensure its as cheap as possible
 * IF there is no need to spill into it.
 * <br>
 * And implementation MUST also assume that it lives for the life of a request.  A new one will be constructed on
 * every request, another reason to be LAZY on file creation say.
