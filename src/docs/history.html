	    <h3>History</h3>

        <p>SiteMesh was originally written about 6 years ago, after Joe Walnes
        downloaded the first sun servlet engine and wrote it using servlet
        chains (before filters).</p>

        <p>He had been using it internally for about 2 years and by the time it
        was open sourced it was quite mature. Over the years, the basic design
        remained the same; content was intercepted, parsed, a decorator mapper
        was used to find a decorator and they were merged together.</p>

<p>The original version used a bunch of regular expressions to extract the necessary
chunks of text from the document. This was easy to get running, but very error prone 
as the matches had no context about where they were in a document. For example, a 
&lt;title&gt; element in a &lt;head&gt; block is very important to SiteMesh, however sometimes
they appear elsewhere, such as in a comment, &lt;script> or &lt;xml&gt; block.
</p>
<p>This was dumped, in favour of a DOM based parser, which initially used JTidy
to convert HTML to XHTML so it could be traversed as a standard DOM tree. Much nicer, 
but very, very sloow. Too slow, so sitemesh was switched to use OpenXML, an XML parser 
that was tolerant to nasty HTML, giving a slight boost to performance. </p>
<p>
By this time, SiteMesh had been open-sourced, and along came Victor Salaman, 
who was the third user to discover it (after Mike Cannon-Brookes and Joseph Ottinger). 
He saw the potential but hated the parser. About three hours later, he'd produced
his own version that used low-level string manipulation. It wasn't pretty, but it
was very, very fast - twelve times faster than the OpenXML one, with the bonus
feature of not rewriting great chunks of the document. This brought SiteMesh into
the mainstream as it was now ready for use on high-traffic sites. 1.0 was released.</p>

<p>There were 2 main leaps that helped make it successful - the rewrite
        from servlet-chain to servlet-filter when the first draft of the Servlet
        2.3 API came out and Victor Salaman rewriting the parser to make it
        about 12 times faster. In December 2003, Chris Miller and Hani Suleiman
        improved the parser to make it again 6 times faster and further 
        minimize memory usage.</p>
