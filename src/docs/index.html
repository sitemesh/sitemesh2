        <h4>What Is It?</h4>

        <ul>

        <li><p>SiteMesh is a web-page layout and decoration framework and web-
        application integration framework to aid in creating large sites
        consisting of many pages for which a consistent look/feel, navigation
        and layout scheme is required.</p></li>

        <li><p>SiteMesh intercepts requests to any static or dynamically
        generated HTML page requested through the web-server, parses the page,
        obtains properties and data from the content and generates an
        appropriate final page with modifications to the original. This is based
        upon the well-known <i><a
        href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GangOfFour">GangOfFour</a> Decorator</i>
        design pattern.</p></li>

        <li><p>SiteMesh can also include entire HTML pages as a <b>Panel</b>
        within another page. This is similar to a Server-Side Include, except
        that the HTML document will be modified to create a visual window (using
        the document's <b>Meta-data</b> as an aid) within a page. Using this
        feature, <i>Portal</i> type web sites can be built very quickly and
        effectively. This is based upon the well-known <i><a
        href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GangOfFour">GangOfFour</a> Composite</i>
        design pattern.</p></li>

        <li><p>SiteMesh is built using Java 2 with Servlet, JSP and XML
        technologies. This makes it ideal for use with J2EE applications, however it
        can be integrated with server-side web architectures that are not Java based
        such as CGI (Perl/Python/C/C++/etc), PHP, Cold Fusion, etc...</p></li>

        <li><p>SiteMesh is very extensible and is designed in a way in which it is
        easy to extend for custom needs. </p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <p>There are many web application platforms that are in common use, and even
        more frameworks. Typically, a web-application is built for a specific
        framework on a specific platform (e.g. using custom JSP tag-libraries on the
        J2EE platform, a custom Perl collaboration API using CGI, or a pre-written
        application using PHP). A web-site may usually consist of many web-
        applications built with a variety of technologies.</p>

        <p>However, while individually each of these web-applications may look and
        perform as expected, they are often hard to integrate with the page layout
        of the existing site and can often end up isolated, attached to the site
        merely by a hyperlink. </p>

        <p>The most common reason for this is if a site is a mixture of custom
        developed pages/applications and pre-written 'out-of-the-box' software. This
        software may not be configurable enough to be given the desired look and
        feel of the rest of the site, or may be developed using a different
        technology to the rest of the site, restricting the developer from using
        fragments of the application in other pages of the site.</p>

        <p>For example, how many times have you been to a site that has a very
        consistent feel all the way through, only to get to the 'search-results'
        page and wonder if you were still on the same site? Or how many times have
        you seen a framework or web-application that you would love to use on your
        site but it will not integrate with what you already have?</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>

        <p>The solution is to work with the HTML that is generated by the various
        web-apps instead of hacking at the underlying code (although SiteMesh is
        primarily geared towards HTML based sites, it is built in an extensible
        manner allowing it to be easily adapted to other mediums such as XML, WML,
        PDF, etc). </p>

        <p>Each application should produce a plain vanilla version of the HTML
        content it wants to display. How this is achieved does not matter - it could
        be a static HTML page, XML/XSL transformation, Servlet, CGI script, etc.
        </p>

        <p>The HTML content is intercepted on its way back to the web-browser where
        it is parsed. The contents of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag and the
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag are extracted as well as meta-data properties
        of the page (such as title, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags and attributes of
        the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags).</p>

        <p>From the extracted meta-data, an appropriate <b>Decorator</b> is
        determined. A decorator can be thought of as a skin for a page - it wraps a
        plain looking page with a consistent look and feel. This decorator then
        overlays the original page.</p>

        <p>To use SiteMesh, it needs to be <a href="install.html">installed,
        configured</a> and <a href="decorators.html">have some decorators
        created</a>. This process can be completed in minutes, and no coding
        experience is required. No changes need to be made to your existing web-
        pages/applications!</p>

        <h3>Visual Example</h3>

        <p>2 pages are produced from different systems (one is a JSP and the other
        is a pre-written CGI script). Both pages are parsed and have a decorator
        overlaid to produce final page of a consistent look.</p>
